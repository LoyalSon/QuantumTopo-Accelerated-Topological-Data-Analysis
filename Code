## Example: Quantum Persistent Homology

```python
from quantum_tda import QuantumPersistentHomology
import numpy as np

# Generate sample point cloud data
n_points = 100
dimension = 3
data = np.random.rand(n_points, dimension)

# Initialize quantum persistent homology calculator
qph = QuantumPersistentHomology(max_homology_dimension=2)

# Compute persistent homology using quantum algorithm
persistence_diagrams = qph.compute_persistence_diagrams(data)

# Visualize results
qph.plot_persistence_diagrams(persistence_diagrams)
```

## Theoretical Speedup

The repository includes a detailed analysis of computational complexity:

| Problem | Classical Complexity | Quantum Complexity | Speedup |
|---------|---------------------|-------------------|---------|
| Persistent Homology | O(n^3) | O(n log n) | Exponential |
| Betti Number Estimation | O(n^3) | O(sqrt(n)) | Polynomial |
| Vietoris-Rips Complex | O(n^2) | O(n log n) | Near-Quadratic |

## Results

The implementations demonstrate significant computational advantages over classical TDA methods, particularly for:

1. High-dimensional point clouds
2. Large-scale datasets
3. Complex topological features requiring higher-dimensional homology groups
